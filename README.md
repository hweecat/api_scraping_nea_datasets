# Scraping Meteorological Data from NEA via Data.gov.sg APIs
This is an ongoing (and on-and-off, depending on how much free time @hweecat has after work/meetups) personal project to create a data scraper for scraping meteorological data from NEA via Data.gov.sg APIs.

Currently, the datasets that are being scraped from are:
1. Realtime Weather Readings across Singapore
- Air Temperature across Singapore
- Rainfall across Singapore
- Relative Humidity across Singapore
- Wind Direction across Singapore
- Wind Speed across Singapore
2. PM2.5 (code refactoring in progress)
3. UV Index (work in progress)

Language: Python
